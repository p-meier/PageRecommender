##How to setup?

###IDE
Simply import this as a maven-project. I used IntelliJ IDEA to build this.

This library isn't in central maven. You have to do a ``git clone`` and a ``maven install`` for this to work.

Everything is described here: [How to install and setup this library](https://github.com/p-meier/deliciousfeeds4J#how-to-install-and-setup-this-library)
